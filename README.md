# heart-disease_prediction_model
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical data. 
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

#Features
- Predicts heart disease likelihood using patient data
- Built using Logistic Regression (can be extended to other models)
- Well-commented code and organized structure

The dataset used contains medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Rest ECG
- Max heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- Oldpeak
- ST slope
- Target (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)
